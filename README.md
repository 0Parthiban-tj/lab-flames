# ProGrad Lab | FLAMES

## A Quick Introduction

We all would have heard or in fact played the FLAMES game atleast once. Logically the game doesn't make a lot of sense, but it definitely is a lot of fun. And hence we thought, why not build it with the help of our ProGrads? 

(If you haven't heard of this game before, then quickly google it up & understand before you proceed)

## What should you do
```
Fork this repo
Clone this repo
Practice Java basics - operators, conditions, loops, class and object
```

## How To Submit
```
Upon completion, run the following commands:

git add .
git commit -m "ProGrad ID"
git push origin master

And finally, create a pull request so your ProGrad Mentor (PM) can review your work.
```

## Instructions
Go to Java Resources -> src folder. You will have two packages src/controller and src/service.
You need to modify src/controller/FlamesCheck and src/service/FlamesCheckService. Do not modify the entire code. Instructions are given in comments. Edit the code as per the instructions given in the class files.

## Run the Project
Right - click on the project -> go to Run as -> Run on server. You can check the output in eclipse browser or in your browser.

## Testing
Right - click on the project -> go to Run as -> Junit Test. All the testcases must be evaluated.

## Progressions
FlamesCheckService has a method findFlames to find the flames between two names
char findFlames(String name1, String name2) takes two strings as arguments
Your task is to calculate the flames value and return the corresponding character as output 
You must return only the following values ['f','l','a','m','e','s']
change the return value at the end of the method corresponding to your return value
